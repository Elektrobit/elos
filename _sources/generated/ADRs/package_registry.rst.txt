Evaluation of the gitlab package registry, with regards to storing and using the elos subproject debian packages.
=================================================================================================================

Evaluation of the debian package registry
-----------------------------------------

The creation of the debian package registry in gitlab, using the
official documentation worked as specified by the documentation. But
uploading an debian package did not.

Uploading using dput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evaluating the debian dput command was not possible, since the command
requires a debian packages .change file, which is not created when
building the .deb file using cpack

Uploading using curl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation specifies the following command to upload a .deb file
to the registry when no .change file is available:

.. code:: shell

   curl --request PUT --user "user:token" --get --data "distribution=registry" --data "component=main" "https://gitlabintern.emlix.com/api/v4/projects/62/packages/debian" --upload-file packages/cmocka_extensions_0.42.3_amd64.deb

This command failed with '{"error":"The provided content-type '' is not
supported."}'

Explicitly stating a content type, as in:

.. code:: shell

   curl --request PUT --user "user:token" --get --data "distribution=registry" --data "component=main" "https://gitlabintern.emlix.com/api/v4/projects/62/packages/debian" --upload-file packages/cmocka_extensions_0.42.3_amd64.deb --header "CONTENT-TYPE: binary"

results in the error message 'An error has occurred and reported in the
system's low-level error handler.' All current attempts to debug this
error further were not successful

Generic repository
------------------

No creation of a repository is necessary, and uploading a debian file
using

.. code:: shell

   curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: token" --upload-file $(pwd)/cmocka_extensions_0.42.3_amd64.deb "https://gitlabintern.emlix.com/api/v4/projects/62/packages/generic/corbos_tools/0.42.3/cmocka_extensions_0.42.3_amd64.deb"

works.

Creating a debian repository inside the generic repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to upload a debian Repositories Package file to the
generic repository. However, it seemed not possible to the access the
registry as a debian repository using the command

.. code:: shell

   add-apt-repository "[trusted=yes] https://gitlabintern.emlix.com/api/v4/projects/62/packages/generic/corbos_tools/0.42.3"

Trying to add the repository without the 'trusted=yes' does work, but
then accessing the repository using ``apt update`` resulted in an error
since the repository is not a signed official one.

Downloading debian files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Downloading a debian file from the generic repository works using the
command

.. code:: shell

   curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: token" "https://gitlabintern.emlix.com/api/v4/projects/62/packages/generic/corbos_tools/0.42.3/cmocka_extensions_0.42.3_amd64.deb" --output cmocka_extensions.deb

This file can the be installed using dpkg
