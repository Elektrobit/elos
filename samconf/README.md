# samconf

Library to manage program configuration options.

## Building

samconf uses CMake for building:

```bash
cmake -B ./build ./samconf
make -C ./build all
make -C ./build install
```

or use the CI hooks

```bash
./samconf/ci/build.sh [Release]
```

### Workspace setup

1. Please run the following git commands after cloning the repository:

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

   to set the commit message template and to setup the project specific git hooks.

2. Usually it is a good idea to create a symlink to the compilation database
   created by cmake in the build directory. Run therefore:

   ```
   ln -s build/compile_commands.json
   ```
