# Event Logging and Management System (elos)

<img src="doc/static/elos_blue.svg" width=20% height=20% align="right">

elos is a tool to collect, store and publish various system events (i.e. syslogs, core dumps, measurements obtained from proc- and sys-fs, …) while providing easy access to the collected data.


## Documentation

The elos documentation can be found here: https://elektrobit.github.io/elos/

## Quick start

### Try elos

```bash
./elos/ci/docker-target-run.sh
...
ci@2153762153:/$ elosc -f "1 1 EQ"
...
ci@2153762153:/$ elosc -s "1 1 EQ"
```

On a second shell attach to the running container

```bash
docker exec -ti <elos_container_name> bash
ci@2153762153:/$ elosc -p '{"payload": "Hello elos"}'
```

For detailed build instructions have a look into `./elos/ci/docker-target-run.sh`
and/or consult the documentation https://elektrobit.github.io/elos .


## Building

elos uses CMake for building:

```bash
cmake -B ./build ./elos
make -C ./build all
make -C ./build install
```

or use the CI hooks

```bash
./elos/ci/build.sh [Release]
```


## Development

For a quick start to get hands on the code and start coding use :
```bash
./elos/ci/docker-run.sh
```
You are now in a ready to use development environment. To build elos and all
dependencies run:
```bash
ci@62209400:/base$ ./elos/ci/build.sh
```
To start elosd and play with your changes:
```bash
ci@62209400:/base$ ./elos/test/smoketest/smoketest_interactive.sh
[elos-interactive]$ elosd&
...
[elos-interactive]$ elosc -f "1 1 EQ"
...
[elos-interactive]$ elosc -s "1 1 EQ"&
...
[elos-interactive]$ elosc -p '{"payload": "Hello elos"}'
...
[elos-interactive]$ elosc # be creative
```
Be aware this is a smoketest environment so it is very verbose.

### Workspace setup

1. Please run the following git commands after cloning the repository:

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

   to set the commit message template and to setup the project specific git hooks.

2. Usually it is a good idea to create a symlink to the compilation database
   created by cmake in the build directory. Run therefore:

   ```
   ln -s build/compile_commands.json
   ```
